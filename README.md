# Workday Planner 

## A simple calendar application that features a responsive user interface powered by jQuery.

This application was built so that I could gain experience with Third-Party APIs; as such, I make extensive use of jQuery, among others.

Currently, this application offers a daily planner that is color-coded based on the current time of day. Events can be entered in each designated time block and saved to local storage with a click of a button. In the future, I would like to modify the CSS for a sleeker design. 

## Installation

To use this application, follow the link on the repository page; otherwise, you can [click here](https://meganjacobs97.github.io/day-planner/).

To modify the code to suit your purposes, you can use an IDE such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Usage 

The current day is displayed at the top of the page. All time blocks that have already passed are gray, the current hour time block is red, and the future time blocks are green. 

To use this application, simply click in any time block and write in an event; then, you can save your entry by clicking the button to the right of the time block.
